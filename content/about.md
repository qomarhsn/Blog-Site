### Hi there 👋

#### I am a full-time learner and part-time Linux, FOSS, and tech enthusiast.

Currently learning **C programming** and exploring how things work at a lower level.<br>
I enjoy building simple web projects with clean and open tools.<br>
I write blog posts on this blog, sharing my journey, tips, and thoughts on tech and programming.

- 🧠 I know: `HTML`, `CSS`, `Tailwind CSS`, and basic `JavaScript`
- 🌱 Learning: **C**, with plans to explore **C++** and **Python**
- 💻 I use: `Linux` as my OS and `VSCodium` as my code editor
- 💬 `ping` me about **Linux**, **tech topics**, or **programming**
