### Hi there 👋

#### I am a full-time learner and part-time Linux, FOSS, and tech enthusiast.

Currently, I’m learning **C++** with a focus on mastering **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** to build strong problem-solving skills.<br>
I enjoy building simple web projects with clean and open tools.<br>
I write blog posts sharing my journey, tips, and thoughts on tech and programming at [blog.qomarhsn.com](https://blog.qomarhsn.com).<br>

* 🧠 I know: `HTML`, `CSS`, `Tailwind CSS`, `basic JavaScript`, and `C`
* 🌱 Learning: **C++ for DSA**, with plans to **master Python**
* 💻 I use: `Linux` as my OS and `VSCodium` as my code editor
* 💬 Ping me about **Linux**, **tech topics**, or **programming**
